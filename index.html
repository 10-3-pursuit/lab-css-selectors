    <h1>Lenny Lopez</h1>

      <p id="p1">
        I'm 28 years old and I live in New York. The Bronx to be specific. When it comes to programming, that is something that has been on my mind for a couple years but never really pursued it until recently when I reconnected with an old friend and learned that he was a 'programmer'. More importantly he told me that he had completed the Pursuit program. After that one thing led to another and here I am, at Pursuit. Besides programming, I'm big on exercise. I try to stay active as much as I can

      <p id="p2">
        My hardest bug I ever came across so far probably has do to do with some sort of for loop.

      <p id="p3">The solution I came up with was just looking back at what I learned previously along with the help of chatGPT.</p>
