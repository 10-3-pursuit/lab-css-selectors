    <h1>Jazon Younge</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        I was born in Guyana and moved to Brooklyn when I was 5.
        I lived in Brooklyn until I was 16, then moved to mid- I
        mean Staten Island. I don't exactly miss Brooklyn, but 
        having to travel hours to reach anywhere important is a 
        pain. Anyways, I discovered my appreciation for programming
        through my love of learning and technology. I always thought
        that programming was far too technical and only viable for 
        geniuses or enthusiasts. Then I tried it, and realized that
        the only barrier in my way was my will to try and to learn.
        Now I'm in module two of Pursuit! How crazy is that?

      <h2>Hardest Bug So Far</h2>
      <p>
        I'm afraid I have'nt been coding long enough
        have a good answer to this question. All of 
        the bugs I faced so far were due to scope 
        issues or bad syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        To find solutions to hard bugs, I usually 
        just comment out the bad code and re-write 
        new code under it. That way I can code again
        with a fresh mind. Most of the time that works
        just fine.
