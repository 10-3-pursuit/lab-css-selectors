      <p class="words">
        Hello! My name is Christopher Miranda and I am a 26 year old from Yonkers, NY. I got into coding as it was always an interest of mine, but I never took any action on it. As a kid, I had been the <i>troubleshooter</i> in the house for anything computer/internet related. After not finishing college <small>(as I didn't know what I wanted to major in)</small> I worked dead end jobs for a couple of years. I was then introduced to <strong>Pursuit</strong> from a friend of mine and figured it was the best course of action to be where I want in the future.

      <p class="words">
        My hardest bug I ever came across was the first lab we were importing/exporting files on. I could not get my code to run as I failed to properly reference with a missing "./"

      <p class="words">Being that it was so small, and it was so new, I could not figure out what was wrong until my instructor <strong>Carlos</strong> pointed it out. </p></p>
